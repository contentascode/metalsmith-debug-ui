Browser based debug interface for [metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io)

Provides nice ui to navigate metalsmith files and metadata, allowing you to
view any stage of the build process

Features:

 * nice ui for exploring files & metadata
 * can jump forwards and backwards through the build process
 * cool react based client

See the [annotated source][1] or [github repo][2]

## install

`npm i --save ${pkg.name}`

## usage

`metalsmith-debug-ui` clones your metalsmith files and metadata strutures at
different times during the build process and stores this history. Then it
injects a browser based client into your build output which allows you to view
that history.

### patch mode
This will report after every plugin. You need to patch your metalsmith instance
with `debugUi.patch`.

```javascript
import Metalsmith from 'metalsmith'
import debugUi from 'metalsmith-debug-ui'

let ms = Metalsmith('src')

debugUi.patch(ms)

ms
.use(...)
.build(...)
```

### report mode

Just call `debugUi.report` as a plugin

```javascript
import Metalsmith from 'metalsmith'
import debugUi from 'metalsmith-debug-ui'

let ms = Metalsmith('src') // no need to patch

ms
.use(myFirstPlugin({...}))
.use(mySecondPlugin({...}))
.use(debugUi.report('stage 1'))
.use(myFirstPlugin({...}))
.use(debugUi.report('stage 2'))
.build(...)
```

### viewing output

The client should be built with the rest of your site, and will be located at
`debug-ui/index.html` in your build directory. You should use your favourite
static development server to view it in the same way you would view anything
else in your build directory.

### errors during build

In patch mode if a plugin throws an exception, no further plugins will be
executed but debug-ui will still be written to your build directory.

In report mode if a plugin throws an exception, metalsmith will just die (as is
normal behaviour). However, the last call to `debugUi.report` would have already
written the debug ui to your build directory.

Because remaining plugins are not called in either mode, plugins like
`metalsmith-dev-server` will not be called, so you won't be able to view
the debug ui. I recommend implementing [browser-sync][browser-sync] instead.

### anonymous plugins

The only way debug-ui can identify a plugin is to read the name of the function
returned by that plugin, but most plugins return anonymous functions. There's
a number of ways you can reduce this problem.

__ metalsmith-sugar __
[metalsmith-sugar][metalsmith-sugar] allows for a different syntax for your
build process, and also provides named functions as plugins. It completely
solves this problem if you use the alternative syntax.

__ debugUI.report __
even if you're using patch mode, you can still slip in a few `debugUi.report`
calls, which will create markers in your list of plugins.

__ fix the plugin __
If you're a plugin maintainer, please look into returning a named function
instead of an anonymous one. If you submit a PR somewhere, mention it in
[this issue][anonymous vs named plugins]

## demo

see [metalsmith-all-the-things][metalsmith-all-the-things] for a full working
demo.

## options

nil

## plugin compatibility

Some plugins may not write to the `debug-ui` log, although I haven't found any
yet. In theory any plugins using `debug v2.x.x` should work. If you find one
please post an issue.

## testing

nil.

## building

Deprecation warning re: parseQuery is from upstream package. Don't worry about
it.

`npm run watch`
